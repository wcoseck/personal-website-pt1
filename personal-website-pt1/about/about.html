        Video Editing, Video Production, Film Analysis

      <p>
        I've always been interested in every form of art, specifically, video
        production and editing. From an early age I started off my interest for
        the composition of video collection, films have always been an interest
        of mine, reading is also an all time favorite activity, and movies are
        not the exception. Knowing how to manipulate camera angles, lighting,
        color techniques to convey a message are all things I enjoy doing. I've
        worked on many personal projects that don't really center around a
        serious form of video editing - instead - I take many liberties when it
        comes to my creative work with video editing, this specific style of
        video editing is directed to young audiences through the medium of
        social media and the continuos use of popular celebrities, shows and
        more, to give you a better perspective, here are some of the thumbnails
        showcasing how well my work has done.

      <h4 style="font-weight: 600">Writing and Reading</h4>
      <p>
        Writing and reading have always been one of the personal interests that
        I hold the dearest. For some time I tried becoming a writer, a
        children's book author, and a journalist. I started by writing a
        collection of poems that hold a powerful message that try to build a
        reader's analytical skills through the use rhetorical devices. The idea
        behind the collection was to build poems and books that are unusual for
        kids to read, they were suppose to be a breathe of fresh air. Explicit
        forms of writing were suppose to illustrate real life experiences to
        children instead of using poor choice of vocabulary.

      <h4 style="font-weight: 600">Working Out</h4>
      <p>
        Working out has always been part of my routine, I've always enjoyed
        waking up early in the morning, that's one fo the aspects of my
        discipline that I most value, I would always wake up at 4 am to attend
        to the gym, even during holidays, discipline, ethics, morals and good
        work ethic all are part of my daily life, and working out is just a
        reflection of this.
