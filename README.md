# Personal Website (pt.1) 

This project contains a personal website deisgned for employers to look at and potentially view you (me) as a part of their team. With a niche and professional layout, this website contains a home page which I've incorporated some html and css along with javascript for functionality. Along with this, this website include an about-me page and a portfolio page. You can swiftly navigate through this through the links in the embedded header on top.
