                The first project that I worked on that involves web development would be the bibliography of Jon Bernthal. 
                The web page was suppose to depict his best work, his life and current activity as a celebrity. The page itself was a bit of a test to see if I could make something functional with some Javascript and some CSS, and HTML. 
                The web page is functional and the design was a mimic of another website to try and have an already established layout for the page without having to spend so much time thinking about the layout and patterns. 
                The page was simply a more sophisticated Wikipedia. The page is up until this date a work in progress, there are many syntax errors to fix and many more things to add and correct.
