        <p>Aspiring Developer, Programmer, Artist</p>
        <p>
          Resourceful and dedicated individual with excellent analytical skills
          and a demonstrated commitment. Strong organizational abilities, with
          proven successes managing workplaces. Exceptional interpersonal and
          team building skills with an aptitude for building rapport with a
          diverse range of customers, managers, and colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interested in bringing ingenuity and innovation to people by allowing
          them to create new ideas under the sun. Every interaction, no matter
          how big or small, its an opportunity to say yes. So no matter the size
          of teams that developers may be a part of, whether it is big or small,
          I'll always be willing to help each other along the way.
